The pod communicates with Pi using Serial Cable. Hence, commands and sensor reading data is transferred through Serial. Every Sensor writes to Serial so that Pi can use that data. In order to gather data from Pi Arduino receives Commands through Serial.

To get the list of commands and full overview of Connections, check github repo. \href{https://github.com/teamwaterloop/control}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/teamwaterloop/control}\hypertarget{index_project_sec}{}\section{Project Structure}\label{index_project_sec}
This code base manages the code from all repositories and will make the code work as whole. Sensor reading and subsystems will be used to make decisions. Commands are used to toggle various states in the program. Check the documentation of each class to get a better idea of what is happening.
